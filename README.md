# portfolio-website
A website I have built showcasing my Computer Science portfolio. The purpose of this website is to let people know me better and interact with me directly. 

I have used HTML, CSS, JS for front-end of this website. 
Upon overcoming monetary issues, I am looking to integrate APIs in the backend to faciitate communication between viewers and me.
